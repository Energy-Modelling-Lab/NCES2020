# ON-TIMES for NCES2020

This is the repository of the open-source ON-TIMES energy system model developed by [EML](https://energymodellinglab.com), IVL (https://www.ivl.se/) and VTT (https://www.vttresearch.com/en) as part of the Nordic Clean Energy Scenarios project conducted by [NER](https://www.nordicenergy.org/).


## Short description

The model includes all of the five nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Island, Norway and Sweden)

The ON-TIMES model is build on the structures of the NER SHIFT project (https://www.nordicenergy.org/flagship/project-shift/) and the TIMES-DK model (https://www.esymodels.man.dtu.dk/times-dk)

The ON-TIMES model is based on the [TIMES model generator](https://iea-etsap.org/index.php/etsap-tools/model-generators/times).

On-TIMES: Open Nordic - The Integrated Market Allocation EFOM System

The ON-TIMES model version v1.final was run in [VEDA2.0](https://iea-etsap.org/index.php/etsap-tools/data-handling-shells/veda) using the CPLEX solver.
